<p>
Click here for <a href="papers/KarloffShirleyAppendix.pdf">the Appendix</a> to the paper.
It contains proofs of some of the theorems in the paper, as well as an interesting 
bad example for the greedy heuristic.

EXAMPLES

Below are some example pictures of summary trees. Click any of the five links below to 
view .pdf files, each of which contains a set of 99 summary trees 
(with k=2, 3, ..., 100 nodes) for a real-world data set (where the data set descriptions 
are taken from the paper):

<ol>

<li>
<a href="summarytrees/summarytrees_webtraffic.pdf">Web Traffic</a>: A set of aggregated webpage visits to a 
large Internet portal by a sample of a million users on one day in March, 2012. The nodes of 
this tree are webpages that are organized hierarchically into categories (such as "/home/news/international/russia," 
for example, or "/home/sports/baseball"), and the weights are the number of clicks per webpage 
aggregated across all users. There are 19,335 nodes in this tree, with a depth of 17 levels, a 
range of zero to 365 children per node, and total weight of over 260 million. The distribution 
of weights per node is highly skewed, with one webpage receiving over 20% of all clicks, and a 
long tail in which 45% of webpages received 3 or fewer clicks.
</li>

<li>
The <a href="summarytrees/summarytrees_gauss.pdf">Carl Gauss subtree</a> of the Mathematics Genealogy Project: 
This tree has 43,527 nodes, all given a weight of 1. For students with multiple advisors, we 
forced the graph to be a tree by assigning the primary advisor as the parent. We 
thank <a href="http://genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/">The Mathematics Genealogy Project</a> for 
the use of its data.
</li>

<li>
<a href="summarytrees/summarytrees_directory.pdf">Hard Drive</a>: One co-author's hard drive, which 
contains 15,671 files and directories, with node weights set to file sizes in kilobytes. 
This drive has a total of 143,990,819 kilobytes of disk space, where the tree has a 
depth of 6 levels, and the number of children per node ranges from zero to 5,342.
</li>

<li>
<a href="summarytrees/summarytrees_treeoflife.pdf">Tree of Life</a>: The phylogenetic tree data from 
the <a href="http://tolweb.org/tree/">Tree of Life Web Project</a>. This tree has 94,080 nodes, 
54,121 of which represent a species or subspecies (and were given a weight of 1), and the 
other 39,959 of which represent a taxonomic categorization (such as ``animal" or 
``plant," and thus were given a weight of zero).
</li>

<li>
<a href="summarytrees/summarytrees_orgchart.pdf">Org chart</a>: A section of an employee organizational 
chart, from a large company, which contains 43,134 employees, all given a weight of one.
</li>

</ol>

For a good viewing experience, I like to open one of these .pdf files using Preview 
(the default .pdf viewer for Mac), and choose two settings: (1) View &rarr; PDF 
Display &rarr; Single Page, and (2) View &rarr; Automatically Resize, and then 
scroll through the 99 pages of the file using the arrow keys.
