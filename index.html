I had a great time at <a href='https://ww2.amstat.org/meetings/jsm/2017/'>JSM 2017</a> in Baltimore, MD, last week. I was the discussant in a <a href='https://ww2.amstat.org/meetings/jsm/2017/onlineprogram/ActivityDetails.cfm?SessionID=214028'>session about applications of interactive graphics</a> and I got to listen to three great talks by <a href='http://ryanhafen.com/'>Ryan Hafen</a>, <a href='http://aliciaschep.github.io/'>Alicia Schep</a>, and <a href='http://varianceexplained.org/'>David Robinson</a>. I reviewed some literature about interactive graphics, and I spoke a little bit about how we use interactive graphics on my team at Amazon to do demand forecasting.

After 6.5 wonderful years in the <a href='http://stats.research.att.com/'>statistics research department</a> at AT&amp;T Labs, I was ready for something new, and so I’ve joined the demand forecasting team at Amazon in New York City. I’ll be doing demand forecasting for retail products within the supply chain organization (aka <a href='https://www.amazon.jobs/en/teams/supply-chain-optimization-technologies'>SCOT</a>) with colleagues that include <a href='http://gosset.wharton.upenn.edu/~foster/index.pl'>Dean Foster</a> and <a href='http://stat.rutgers.edu/home/ldicker/Home.html'>Lee Dicker</a>. I’m excited for the new challenge!

This is a very belated post to share the <a href='jsm2015'>slides</a> from my
August 2015 JSM talk about my
<a href='https://github.com/kshirley/summarytrees'>
  <span style='font-family: courier'>summarytrees</span> R package</a>. I've finally
converted our code to compute and visualize summary trees
(co-written with Howard Karloff) into an R package which contains a
mixture of R, C, and javascript code. The GitHub repo for the
package is
<a href='https://github.com/kshirley/summarytrees'>here</a>.
It's not quite a finished product; I plan to clean up some of the
internals before I submit it to CRAN.
</p>
<p>
That being said, I'd love any comments, suggestions, or feedback on the
current development version.
</p>
<p>
For a couple of demos, check out one of these:
<ul>
  <li>The <a href='summarytrees/gauss'>Carl Gauss subtree of the Mathematics
Genealogy Project</a>
  </li>
<li>The <a href='summarytrees/dmozsports'>Sports subtree of the DMOZ directory of webpages</a>
</li>
</ul>
For a vignette illustrating the use of the package, see the
 <a href='summarytrees/vignettes/Gauss.html'>Gauss vignette</a>
or the <a href='summarytrees/vignettes/DMOZ.html'>DMOZ vignette</a>.

Next week Thursday (May 21st) my colleague Wei Wang will present <a href='papers/wang_shirley_w2sp_2015.pdf'>our paper</a> "Breaking Bad: Detecting Malicious Domains Using Word Segmentation" at the <a href='http://ieee-security.org/TC/SPW2015/W2SP/'>Web 2.0 Security and Privacy (W2SP) workshop</a> in San Jose, CA. In the paper we describe how we segmented a set of domain names into individual tokens, and then used the resulting bag of words as an additional feature set to improve the predictive accuracy of our model to detect malicious domains. The outcome variable ("maliciousness") was gathered from the <a href='https://www.mywot.com/'>Web of Trust</a>, a crowdsourced website reputation rating service.
</p>

<p>
Some highlights of this project were:
<ol>
<li>Reading <a href='http://norvig.com/ngrams/'>Peter Norvig's chapter</a> of the book Beautiful Data, which includes a description of the word segmentation algorithm, along with python code to implement it. On a side note, this is the second place I've seen an example of using statistics to break a substitution cipher. The first time was in <a href='http://statweb.stanford.edu/~cgates/PERSI/papers/MCMCRev.pdf'>this very entertaining paper</a> by Persi Diaconis.
</li>
<li>Using the <a href='http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/glmnet/index.html'>R package <span style='font-family: courier'>glmnet</span></a> to do lasso-penalized logistic regression (a really nice way to handle large numbers of features).
</li>
<li>
Discovering that the names of certain basketball players are strongly associated with malicious domains (at least according to our definition of "malicious"), including "kobe", "jordan", and "lebron". I guess Kevin Durant and Carmelo Anthony are probably jealous that their names aren't yet showing up in the domain names of phishing websites as often as their peers.
</li>
</ol>
