	Demo page for LDAvis: A method for visualizing and interpreting topics
      </h3>
      <p>
	This is a demo of 'LDAvis', our interactive visualization tool for topic models fit using LDA. Below is a visualization of a 40-topic model fit to the AP data (2246 Associated Press documents made available by David Blei on his <a href='http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~blei/lda-c/index.html' target='_blank'>website</a>).
      </p>
      <p>
	For an explanation of our tool, see our paper, <a href='http://nlp.stanford.edu/events/illvi2014/papers/sievert-illvi2014.pdf' target='_blank'>LDAvis: A method for visualizing and interpreting topics</a>, to be presented at the <a href='http://nlp.stanford.edu/events/illvi2014/index.html' target='_blank'>2014 ACL Workshop on Interactive Language Learning, Visualization, and Interfaces</a> in Baltimore on June 27, 2014. Or check out <a href='https://github.com/cpsievert/LDAvis' target='_blank'>our repo on github</a>.

	To use the visualization tool, click a circle in the left panel to select a topic, and the bar chart in the right panel will display the 30 most relevant terms for the selected topic, where we define the <i>relevance</i> of a term to a topic, given a weight parameter, 0 &le; &#955; &le; 1, as &#955; log(p(term | topic)) + (1 - &#955;) log(p(term | topic)/p(term)). The red bars represent the frequency of a term in a given topic, (proportional to p(term | topic)), and the blue bars represent a term's frequency across the entire corpus, (proportional to p(term)). Change the value of &#955; to adjust the term rankings -- small values of &#955; (near 0) highlight potentially rare, but exclusive terms for the selected topic, and large values of &#955; (near 1) highlight frequent, but not necessarily exclusive, terms for the selected topic. A user study described in our paper suggested that setting &#955; near 0.6 aids users in topic interpretation, although we expect this to vary across topics and data sets (hence our tool, which allows you to flexiby adjust &#955;).
