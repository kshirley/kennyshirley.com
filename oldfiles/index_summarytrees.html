<p>I am a member of the <a href="http://www.research.att.com/%7Estat">Statistics
Research Department</a> at AT&amp;T Labs in Florham Park, NJ, where I work on
hierarchical Bayesian modeling, MCMC methods, hidden Markov models, and other
topics related to applied statistics.</p>

<p><b>NEWS</b></p>

<p><i>June 8, 2012</i></p>

<p>Here are some plots related to recent work with my colleague Howard Karloff.
We're drawing summaries of large trees that we call ''Maximum Entropy Summary
Trees'' using an algorithm that we've tested on a few examples. The idea is to
summarize a large node-weighted tree (that has, perhaps, tens of thousands of
nodes) by aggregating some of its nodes so that we can visualize the structure
of the tree (i.e. a ''summary'' of the tree) using many fewer nodes ( &lt; 100
nodes, for example).</p>

<p>We'll post the paper with details soon. For now, here are some examples. A
nice way to view these is using Preview on a mac, and selecting ''View &rarr; PDF
Display &rarr; Single Page'' and also ''View &rarr; Automatically Resize''. Then if
you hold down the right or down arrow, it's like watching an animation as the
tree grows from 2 nodes to 100 nodes.</p>

<p>1. <a href="http://www.research.att.com/~kshirley/summarytrees_mathgen.pdf">Math
Genealogy</a>. (Thanks to the <a href="http://www.genealogy.ams.org/">Math
Genealogy Project</a> for sharing their data). This tree has Friedrich Leibniz
(PhD in 1622) as its root, and it has 50,639 nodes, each given a weight of one.
We forced it to be a tree by selecting each student's primary advisor as
his/her parent node in the tree, if he/she had multiple advisors or multiple
PhDs.</p>

<p>2. <a
href="http://www.research.att.com/~kshirley/summarytrees_treeoflife.pdf">Tree
of Life</a>. (Thanks to the <a href="http://tolweb.org/tree/">Tree of Life Web
Project</a> for making their data available). These trees are very lopsided
&#8211; most species in this data are insects. There are 94,080 nodes in the
original tree, and each node labeled as a leaf in the original data (54,121 of
them) is given a weight of one. The zero-weight nodes tend to be categories,
like ''Animal'', rather than species.</p>

<p>3. <a
href="http://www.research.att.com/~kshirley/summarytrees_directory.pdf">Directory</a>.
This tree represents the directory and file structure on my hard drive, where there 
are 15,671 nodes, and the weights of the nodes are file sizes rounded to the nearest 
megabyte (where directories have a weight of zero). A node with a black border in the 
summary tree is a leaf in the original tree. Notice here that it's common for nodes 
with the same parent to be of equal size -- this typically means (in the case of my computer)
that these are either data files where there are many versions of the same data, or MCMC 
output files, where there might be a different, equally-sized output file for 
each starting point. This actually leads to bad visualizations (you don't need to see each
of 30 copies of a similar file), but it's just a reflection of the data.</p>

<p>4. <a
href="http://www.research.att.com/~kshirley/summarytrees_orgchart.pdf">Organizational Chart</a>.
This tree represents a subtree of a company organizational chart, where there are about 43,000
nodes in the tree, and each has a weight of one.
</p>

<p>5. <a
href="http://www.research.att.com/~kshirley/summarytrees_webtraffic.pdf">Web Traffic</a>.
This tree represents web traffic from a sample of clicks to webpages on a large internet portal. The
hierarchy of the tree is defined by the slashes in the URLs of the webpages, and the weights of
the nodes correspond to the number of clicks a given webpage received during the sample time period. Notice
the skewed distribution of clicks to the webpage categories at level 2 of the tree (in the k=10 summary tree, for example).
The maximum entropy summary trees display nodes such that their weights are roughly evenly distributed,
without respect to their level in the tree, thus providing a potentially new way to categorize
webpages in a portal based on traffic volume.
